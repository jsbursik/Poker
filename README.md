# Poker

This is the first draft of a poker range chart commonly used today to show what hands you play in certain positions.

## What needs to change

The creation of the card-combinations table can be MASSIVELY simplified, especially when I switch everything to TypeScript, and I might even just code this in Angular to give myself a much cleaner environment.

I'm thinking about changing how you can share a chart with other people that doesn't involve a CSV, or maybe just a way to make it shorter.

Make it look better by using Bootstrap 4 for the interface.
